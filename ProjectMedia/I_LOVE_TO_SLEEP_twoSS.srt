1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,400
Folks I like to sleep in.
I love to get that extra wing.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,400
But oh how much more important
it is to get up and pray.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,800
Prince spend time with
the Lord in prayer.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,100
I remember Christ in the garden.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:16,700
when he

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,400
finds them asleep in
Matthew finds the Disciples

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,300
of sleep in Matthew 26,
and it's interesting. It says

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,200
in verse 40 of Matthew 26,
they come with it

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,600
to Disciples of finding them
asleep and sayeth unto Peter.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,200
What could you not watch
with me one hour?

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,200
In the instant, he doesn't
say it to all the disciples.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,400
Peter could you not watch
with me one hour why

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,600
Peter Well Peter was the
one to say oh everybody pray for

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,400
sakes you I won't forsake you.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,700
And Peter was an hour away
from denying the

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:51,900
Lord.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,900
You know, maybe.

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,300
Maybe if Peter had been praying
instead of sleeping.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,400
He would have had the faith
to stand up to the maiden and to

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,300
the others and say yes.
I know him. He's my Lord,

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,800
but instead he denied.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,000
Redeeming the time through prayer
