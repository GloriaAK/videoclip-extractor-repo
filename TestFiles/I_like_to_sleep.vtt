00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.000
Folks I like to sleep in. I love to get that extra wink.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.200
But oh how much more important it is to get up and pray.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.500
and it's interesting. It says in verse 40 of Matthew

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.300
26, they come with it to the disciples and find them asleep

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.300
and saith unto Peter.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.100
What could you not watch with me one hour? Isn't it

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.800
interesting, He doesn't say it to all the disciples.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.300
Peter could you not watch with me

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.600
one hour?  Why Peter? Well, Peter was the one to say thought everybody

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.000
forsake you, I won't forsake you.


00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.400
And Peter was an hour away from denying the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.600
Lord.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.900
You know, maybe ...

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.900
maybe if Peter had been praying instead

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.300
of sleeping.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.300
He would have had the faith to stand up to the maiden and to the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.100
others and say yes. I know him. He's my Lord.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.500
But instead he denied.
